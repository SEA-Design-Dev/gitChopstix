I added a link to my GitHub account on my Canvas profile. The rest I had already done.

I completed the Console Foundations and Git courses on Treehouse. Here is a link to my profile with the badges:

I would like to see a tutorial that discussed the differences in installing software on Mac OSX as opposed to unix/linux. I have Homebrew installed but know little about using it. I did find this on the Treehouse forum which was helpful:

But more information would be helpful.

In the terminal tutorial I also enjoyed learning how to change my PS1. I never liked mine.
